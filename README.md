# Path_Tracing_HJT_V1.0
Saitama University HUANG JINGTAO   
C++/ Recursive Monte Carlo Path Tracer  
      
This is a practice project,According to pbrt_v2.
The renderer has only the basic function of path tracing: Recursive Monte Carlo Integration. Additionally I added the BRDF reflection model
to the renderer. I did not optimize the speed of the path tracer.
